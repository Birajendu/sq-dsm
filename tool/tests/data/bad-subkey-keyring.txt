This key keyring contains two keys in the following order: "Justus",
"Neal".

Justus's key includes all of Neal's subkeys.  When Justus's key is
canonicalized, Neal's subkeys should be dropped.

If an application looks for Neal's signing subkey and either doesn't
validate the keys or only filters on the unvalidated keys, then it
will not find the right key.

This was fixed in sqv in commit
1d63e71a839bf68f50cb7f4c1942f0d0b1eccfca.
